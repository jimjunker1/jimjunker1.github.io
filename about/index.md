I am an ecologist with broad interests in the dynamics of communities
and ecosystems. My research spans from arctic streams and rivers to
sub-tropical estuaries.

### Main research questions

-   How do energy and materials move through food webs?

-   How do ecological patterns and processes emerge at varying spatial
    and temporal scales?

-   How are ecosystem function–biodiversity relationships modified by
    the environment?

## Bio

I am originally from Minnesota and grew up fishing and recreating on its
many lakes. My hobbies include hiking, biking, fly fishing and just
generally spending time on the water.
