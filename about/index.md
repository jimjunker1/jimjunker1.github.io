I am an ecologist with broad interests in the dynamics of communities
and ecosystems. My research spans from arctic streams and rivers to
sub-tropical estuaries.

### Main research questions

-   How do energy and materials move through food webs?

-   How do ecological patterns and processes emerge at varying spatial
    and temporal scales?

-   How are ecosystem function–biodiversity relationships modified by
    the environment?

## Bio

I am originally from Minnesota and grew up fishing and recreating on its
many lakes. My hobbies include hiking, biking, fly fishing and just
generally spending time on the water.

## Lab group

Our lab group, the EcoBioGeoChemistry group at the University of North
Texas, is co-run by [Dr. Juliana
D’Andrilli](https://julesdandrilli.wixsite.com/research) and Dr. Jim
Junker. The group is an diverse, interdisciplinary group of scientists
studying the ecology and biogeochemistry of aquatic ecosystems with
research projects spanning aquatic chemistry and carbon cycling to
community and food web ecology.
